                <p style="text-align: center">A unit test is a method that instantiates a small portion of an application and verifies its behavior independently from other parts. </p>

                <h3>Typical unit tests contains 3 phases:</h3>
                <li> First, it initializes a small piece of an application it wants to test</li>
                <li> Then it applies some condition to the system under test</li>
                <li> Finally, it observes the resulting behavior</li>


                <p><br>If the observed behavior is as expected, the unit test passes, otherwise, it fails, indicating that there is a problem somewhere in the system under test.</p>

                <p>These three unit test phases are also known as Arrange, Act and Assert, or simply AAA.</p>

                <h3>Unit tests are designed to test state-based or interaction-based code logic:</h3>
                    <p>Verifying that the system under test produces correct results, or that its resulting state is correct, is called state-based unit testing.
                    <br>Verifying that it properly invokes certain methods is called interaction-based unit testing.
                    </p>

                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""" In the Arrange phase, we create and set up a system under test.This can be empty and is not mandatory"""
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calc = Calculator()
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""The Act phase is where we poke the system under test, usually by invoking a method."""
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calc.subtract_number(1)
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""The Assert phase makes our unit test pass or fail."""

            <li>Easy to write</li>
            <li>Readable</li>
            <li>Reliable</li>
